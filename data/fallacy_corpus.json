If you give the government *any* control over what is considered \"hate speech\", you are basically relinquishing your freedom of speech. It's a slippery slope.  For example: saying \"hateful\" things about Islam becomes illegal. Let's say you criticise Sharia laws (laws based off of the rules set out in Islam for those who are unaware). Next thing you know, your own government has full power to censor this \"hate\", and you are persecuted simply for disagreeing with the laws of an ally nation.  Governments have shown time and time again that they are more than happy to censor and abuse their peoples. Don't ever relinquish your freedoms willingly.",

            "Really good question - as the person in the OP I'd love to clarify, speaking from my own field (critical rhetoric, academic debating, cognitive theory , ethics) feminism has transformed how theory-making is done. This is true in the \"hard sciences\" too, per the many many academic friends I have. For context, I've coached national championship winning debate programs, 5 national championship finalist debaters, and taught in higher education (public university systems) across 5 states and 15 years.      The long and the short of it is, if you are operating in an intellectual space and not engaging feminist critical perspectives then you are doing stone-aged theory and can't get too upset if you're ignored.",

If you are, it makes HRT a lot more effective.

The fault in Pascal's wager is that it's a false dichotomy. It's between just two assumptions; the specific sect in question...or not.  But when your assumption that one sect stands out collapses, you have to consider *any* sect. When you see your sect as just one among many, and no reason why *it's* true versus others, Pascal's Wager collapses because it doesn't include a provision for selecting the right sect.

Since those that actually cared about their offspring ie had a mutation of parental gene, their offspring were more likely to survive and pass the gene on.   So its basically in our DNA to be protective and place a high value on anything seen as offspring. Which pregnancy is seen as offspring.   I dont think its really related to anything vague like potential future of the fetus etc I think the underlying thing is the value humans place on our offspring. Otherwise if they didnt value it they wouldnt even be thinking of potential future etc.  So i think its like Strong parenting nature due to genes = high value on offspring/fetus = thinking of it in many different ways to try and cognitively justify its value.",

What you *should* be arguing against is either the existence of God, OR the premise/conclusion that he created the earth in 6 days. Whether Jesus is perfect is irrelevant if you have already asserted that he is the son of God. Ultimately, these two premises cannot co-exist:  **P1:** Human knowledge is perfect/complete in its understanding that the earth was not created in 6 days  **P2:** The Christian God/Jesus is real ",

            "&gt; First off, most people dont really care THAT much about politics. But this applies to EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD, not just Singaporeans. This anger Ive read on this sub recently directed specifically at Singaporeans is mind boggling because its not like everyone else around the world is politically enlightened. In the US only 60% of the electorate voted in the 2016 presidential elections.  False equivalency. In the US people don't vote for various reasons, due to redlining, voter disenfranchisement, and the darn simple fact that election days are not holiday unlike here. On the other hand, it's somewhat an offense to not vote her, as your name gets struck off the registry and you'll have to pay a 50 dollars fine if you don't have a valid reason.    Not all democracies are enlightened, but if the civil movements and waves of resistance movements in NA and EU are a yardstick of anything, it'll be the opposite of political apathy, at least generationally.  &gt; Furthermore, a lot of people are one-issue voters, which isnt an informed way to make voting decisions either.  Why not? People vote on the platform that pushes their hot-issue buttons the most. Short-sighted as this may be, you yourself mentioned that we have a limited attention span and resources to read and digest manifestos, study the track record of politicians, or catch up on debates and town halls. Humans rely on heuristics when a quick judgement has to be made against resource constraints. Or, humans are lazy, so there is absolutely nothing wrong with voting along a single or several issues for elections. Advanced democracies do this. Brexit was predicated on a lie about NHS financing. Trump won because he painted his opponent to be more untrustworthy as him. In a perfect world, both wouldn't have happened, and I don't think anyone will deny that UK and the US are developed democracies.  &gt; Second, Id say a lot of people need to read up on history more. The older generation wouldnt be as outraged by this because the govt has ALWAYS been like. This tacit social contract between Singaporeans and govt has been in place since before a lot of people on this sub were born.  So what do you get by appealing to tradition? Just because we were in legit danger as a young country circa the Malayan Conspiracy times it means that we must uphold the same social contract our grandparents signed with the powers that be? We can't demand our government to a higher standard of accountability and transparency? We should be thankful that they don't jail all keyboard warriors under ISA 2.0 for 10 years for spreading fake news about TPTB because that's what they did to our forefathers during Coldstore?   &gt; Third, if youre vehemently against something, then please simultaneously think of the alternative solution youd prefer. I see far too many people complain about specific policies (not specifically fake news law) without giving their own better alternative.  Fallacy of false dichotomy/burden of proof. A diner doesn't have to cook better than their chef to be a critic. The electorate shouldn't bear the burden of proof of coming up with alternatives to show that a policy sucks. There's a reason why the Government is supported by research institutes, think-tanks, polling agency and data analytics experts to formulate policies. Asking the layman to come up with a proper alternative or shut up, especially if that retort comes from TPTB, is an indictment against our paternalistic and top-down approach to democracy, that we are serving our MPs and Ministers instead of the other way round.  Still giving you an upvote, because end of the day what we need is this: proper fucking discourse. Not the phony electorate outreach program REACH they use to create phony and dodgy figures whenever they need polling numbers to support a controversial policy, but actual discourse amongst the electorate to be educated and politically aware if not motivated.",
