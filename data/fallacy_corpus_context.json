Like in terms of the government being able to gain access to, say, your emails if they suspect you of something then i think that's true. The government doesn't care about your personal emails, you only need to worry if you're doing something illegal. If that could help fight terrorism then you can see why people think it's a necessary evil.   On the other hand however it does give the government an insane amount of power. Say the government became tyrranical and extremely restrictive, them being able to access your emails enables them to do this. However you could also argue that if the government decided to be tyrranical, they'd access them anyway - they just either wouldn't tell the people or wouldn't ask them about it.   So yeah I'm on the fence really.

Slippery slope arguments are shit and all, but once the policing starts it wont stop at the obvious problematic pairings with illegal age differences (is incest even considered a big issue anymore, what with GoT making it super popular on every porn site ever?), it'll continue on with other common but \"unfit for polite company\" kinks like non-consent and BDSM and then it'll come for queer pairings, and then it's women enjoying sex and at that point corporate will move in to make money off it  //edit: I want to make it clear that I'm not defending stories with pedophilic content, I'm just of the opinion there's worse issues (like the simulated child porn using 3d models that's so common nowadays) and that we have much more to lose than to gain by going down this road",

Really good question - as the person in the OP I'd love to clarify, speaking from my own field (critical rhetoric, academic debating, cognitive theory , ethics) feminism has transformed how theory-making is done. This is true in the \"hard sciences\" too, per the many many academic friends I have. For context, I've coached national championship winning debate programs, 5 national championship finalist debaters, and taught in higher education (public university systems) across 5 states and 15 years.      The long and the short of it is, if you are operating in an intellectual space and not engaging feminist critical perspectives then you are doing stone-aged theory and can't get too upset if you're ignored.",

I think the most plausible answer is that it is a lie made up by a few people and was passed down as truth, just like many other stories in the bible. Inarguably, this would make sense if we're discussing Mormonism or Scientology. However, Judaism and Christianity has taken a foothold over oceans of populations for its veracity in the eyes who behold the truths in the form of finding it to turn out to make more sense than not at all. It is easier to believe God have the 10 commandments at Mt. Sinai, and many people witnessed Moses coming down shining in bright white light, so much so that the tradition to this day globally is that that indeed happened and an entire nation witnessed it, that is how the whole world came to hear of it, unlike Scientology unable to reach Poland or parts of the Earth Christianity and Judaism has.",

            "&gt; First off, most people dont really care THAT much about politics. But this applies to EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD, not just Singaporeans. This anger Ive read on this sub recently directed specifically at Singaporeans is mind boggling because its not like everyone else around the world is politically enlightened. In the US only 60% of the electorate voted in the 2016 presidential elections.  False equivalency. In the US people don't vote for various reasons, due to redlining, voter disenfranchisement, and the darn simple fact that election days are not holiday unlike here. On the other hand, it's somewhat an offense to not vote her, as your name gets struck off the registry and you'll have to pay a 50 dollars fine if you don't have a valid reason.    Not all democracies are enlightened, but if the civil movements and waves of resistance movements in NA and EU are a yardstick of anything, it'll be the opposite of political apathy, at least generationally.  &gt; Furthermore, a lot of people are one-issue voters, which isnt an informed way to make voting decisions either.  Why not? People vote on the platform that pushes their hot-issue buttons the most. Short-sighted as this may be, you yourself mentioned that we have a limited attention span and resources to read and digest manifestos, study the track record of politicians, or catch up on debates and town halls. Humans rely on heuristics when a quick judgement has to be made against resource constraints. Or, humans are lazy, so there is absolutely nothing wrong with voting along a single or several issues for elections. Advanced democracies do this. Brexit was predicated on a lie about NHS financing. Trump won because he painted his opponent to be more untrustworthy as him. In a perfect world, both wouldn't have happened, and I don't think anyone will deny that UK and the US are developed democracies.  &gt; Second, Id say a lot of people need to read up on history more. The older generation wouldnt be as outraged by this because the govt has ALWAYS been like. This tacit social contract between Singaporeans and govt has been in place since before a lot of people on this sub were born.  So what do you get by appealing to tradition? Just because we were in legit danger as a young country circa the Malayan Conspiracy times it means that we must uphold the same social contract our grandparents signed with the powers that be? We can't demand our government to a higher standard of accountability and transparency? We should be thankful that they don't jail all keyboard warriors under ISA 2.0 for 10 years for spreading fake news about TPTB because that's what they did to our forefathers during Coldstore?   &gt; Third, if youre vehemently against something, then please simultaneously think of the alternative solution youd prefer. I see far too many people complain about specific policies (not specifically fake news law) without giving their own better alternative.  Fallacy of false dichotomy/burden of proof. A diner doesn't have to cook better than their chef to be a critic. The electorate shouldn't bear the burden of proof of coming up with alternatives to show that a policy sucks. There's a reason why the Government is supported by research institutes, think-tanks, polling agency and data analytics experts to formulate policies. Asking the layman to come up with a proper alternative or shut up, especially if that retort comes from TPTB, is an indictment against our paternalistic and top-down approach to democracy, that we are serving our MPs and Ministers instead of the other way round.  Still giving you an upvote, because end of the day what we need is this: proper fucking discourse.

Unless your work load has enough `sync` to cause slow downs, it isn't going to help. And if you *do*, you can achieve the same thing w/ `sync=disabled` on that dataset. If your in flight writes are *so important* that you can't do that, then you should be using a *mirrored* SLOG *and* it should be power fail safe *and* it should be fast at writes. It'll only get read in the case of an oh shit, so read speed doesn't matter. Most people think SLOG is a write cache, but it isn't. It is just a place for `sync` writes to live in case the system fails before that `sync` data in memory can be written to the pool as part of a normal flush.

Homophobia is partly a tribalistic response in humans.  He's correct though that animals don't really see a problem with homosexuality, to most animals sex is sex is sex, regardless of the bits involved.  But it's somewhat incorrect to imply that only humans behave in tribalistic ways.  I personally consider tribalism to be one of the most toxic remnants of of our hominid ancestry and the cause of untold strife and violent conflict.  Any ideology that encourages that tribalism (like religiously based homophobia) involves people acting more like apes than rational beings.

Quite often when making this argument, an author will create a simple situation with a very complicated decision to make. The author uses the example of Sophie's choice. In Sophie's choice we have three data points: Sophie has children, Sophie has to choose which go to a work camp and which won't, and the ones that don't go to the work camp. In this situation, there is no basis to make a choice more complex than chance. There is no moral difference between heads or tails. In life there are hundreds of variables. Maybe little Johnny likes to torture animals and little Sarah has terminal cancer. Information like this would impact the choice considerably.  The other issue is this idea that we have to \"like\" the morally correct choice. \"Rightness\" is independent of desire. Making the right choice is often that least desirable choice. In Sophie's choice it is unlikely she would like any of the options but it does not follow that it means there is no right answer. The point of moral philosophy is to tackle the assumption that right is the same as preferable and wrong is the same as undesirable.

Since those that actually cared about their offspring ie had a mutation of parental gene, their offspring were more likely to survive and pass the gene on.   So its basically in our DNA to be protective and place a high value on anything seen as offspring. Which pregnancy is seen as offspring.   I dont think its really related to anything vague like potential future of the fetus etc I think the underlying thing is the value humans place on our offspring. Otherwise if they didnt value it they wouldnt even be thinking of potential future etc.  So i think its like Strong parenting nature due to genes = high value on offspring/fetus = thinking of it in many different ways to try and cognitively justify its value.",

I see these posts constantly, and maybe I\u2019m just dumb, but I don\u2019t get the issue here There exists a social phenomena(I forget the name) whereby if you see that other people agree with something (i.e vote yes on a poll) you are more likely to also vote yes on that poll because humans instinctually like to be on the winning side  By showing poll results while the poll is running, many people will simply vote for the winning option(especially if theyre uninformed on the topic) because its winning so it doesnt matter or if these ppl agree with it its probably right, or if they disagree with the winning option, they wont vote at all because they dont think it matters  By hiding them, people will be more likely to either abstain from voting on things theyre not informed on, or do research and vote for the thing they actually agree with",

You shouldnt just assume this team will be like other teams you have worked with and dismiss them or prejudge their argument based on those experiences, its simply not fair to them. Just exaimine their claim in an objective way. I understand its normal to make generalizations and adjust based ont them but surely you know the fair thing to do is not make any assumptions about a team just because many other teams in the same division do those things. How hard you work and how much passions you have doesnt change that you made an error. We all know your are hard working passionate person. We are not teying to argue you are a bad person or that the mistake is not understandable just that it was an error. Its not a personal attack, atleast by me and others who dont see malicious motivation.  > The comment about SA div teams although not racist was still a bad assumption.  How is it a bad assumption? It's not even an assumption. It's literally an observation based from his dealing with SA teams in the division. He's not assuming anything. Everything comes straight from experience dealing with the teams. He doesn't make any statement saying that's how all teams are like, he just states it's a trend which is nothing but fact.  He doesn't even lump pain with them. He says, \"Although this seems to be a new trend among SA teams it seems that **they** don't know or care about the rules.\" If he was generalizing and insulting Pain he would have said you as in \"you people\" grouping Pain along with the rest of SA.

Not having vertical progression or a gear-treadmill is a strawman argument. The game still needs content whether you go that route or not.   Sea of Thieves literally has two types of fetch-quests and a PvP system with no semblance of balance. It is being launched at full triple-A price with nothing but promise that there will be more content in the future. It's a tech demo my dudes. They're selling you on this \"Games as a Service\", but in reality, that's just early access with extra steps.   If this is successful, Rare has found a way to sell you early access games at full MSRP. The next step will be determining exactly how long a developer needs to support a game before dumping it. It's still a multiplayer sandbox game and it's not released yet! So just wait for the full game, before you complain about content.

However it is mostly a far-right meme, so the crazyness of the world is always something like LGBTQ, feminists, minorities etc existing. So most of the sub was just hatred. I don't know the exact thing that got them banned, but far-right subs in general have been getting banned or quarantined all over the place lately. The problem here is that most people don't hate anyone because of who they are. That's what most leftist don't understand. Sure, there are a few that say they hate people and actually mean it, but mostly it's not about hate. The majority of people there didn't hate LGBT, minorities, or feminists. We were just tired of hearing about how oppressed they were and how they had no rights, and how they deserved so much more. We were all for equal rights, but equal rights means exactly that: equal. You don't get to celebrate your differences, your differences don't make you better than us. Thta's not equality means. If you want to celebrate your differences, then don't get pissy when straight white men want to celebrate their differences as well.

There's no God's stance on LGBT, because Jesus never spoke about it. If he did, it was not recorded. You'd think if God cared about LGBT, Jesus would've talked about it.  If Christians who are obsessed with pointing out homosexuality is a sin REALLY cared about Paul's stance so much, they'd also be celibate like Paul and also be against marriage altogether, just like Paul was. But that's not what's happening. They're just blaming their own irrational fear of homosexuality on Paul. Jesus didn't talk about a lot of things like necrophilia or rape.

To take it a step further, bathing regularly was once not a common practice for humans but I'd wager you showered this morning.

It\u2019s against the spirit of the format. There isn\u2019t really a strong enough argument to change what we are already doing. And if you think that extort is confusing, how about playing a Beseech the Queen in a white deck. It would burn my eyes to see that. Lol. A lot of the fun of the format is being restricted and having to make cuts to fine tune your deck and make it function smoothly in your chosen colours. You have a great article with well thought out reasons , I just don\u2019t agree with them and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a strong enough argument to change. That's definitely fair.  That you took the time to read what I wrote is what matters.  It is a shame I couldn't sway your opinion, but it is what it is.   In my opinion I don't think changing how Colour Identity interacts with Hybrid cards is in any way is against the spirit of the format.  I'll concede that my suggestion for the 2-brid cards was probably a bad one.  I can agree that they should stay as their singular colours instead of my idea of making them colourless.  However with concerns to the fun of deck building for the format, I have always found some restrictions non-sensical.  Why can I only play [[Scapheap Scrounger]] in a Black deck?  Why do I have to be running White **and** Red to play Archangel Avacyn?

I posted it here because I follow keto and think it's a useful diet and sub, but also think that some equanimity / moderation is needed.

Lando did not come across as fluid or pan or whatever they're saying he is. Because he has 0 romantic or sexual interactions in the movie. I would make no assertions at all about his sexuality. It's completely valid to say that it must be present in the movie to be a part of the movie.

This is undeniably true, because in this scenario businesses will have free reign to exploit every possible financial advantage. However, what they did not agree on is workers rights/wages, the inevitable trade deficits of wealthier counties (which Keynes hated), and the risk to national security of having so little production of vital tools and materials made within your own nation. Free trade maximizes profitability for the .1% that can afford to exploit the world market, at the expense of the other 99.9%. Nationwide regulation has nothing to do with whether or not a country has tariffs.   Trade deficits mean nothing economically.   Keynes was the only person in this list against trade deficits according to you, which doesnt override the other 4-5 economists  Workers will have the same rights regardless of whether or not there are tariffs across the borders.   (In the US) We are already perfectly capable of creating all of these materials ourselves, its just more efficient for all parties involved (consumer, producer, worker) to outsource them somewhere else.

Dassey kept asking the police that day, **\u201cDo you think he did it?**,\u201d referring to his uncle. **This struck O\u2019Neill as odd since at that point Teresa Halbach had been listed as a missing person not a homicide.**   What did Avery do?

Even when you assume that plants are sentient, veganism is still the most reasonable and ethical option. you have these ethics about killing animals, so you kill plants, as if there are only two forms of life and ethics is the decider of which to kill. i would say its not an informed choice.  the oldest and simplest life forms, of which there are six, can outsmat you and kill you, being alive is a risky business, and ethics wont save you, the name of the game we all play is not 'be the most ethical' you are gonna lose if you dont follow the rules, survive or die, same for everything, even the one celled players get it.",

You don't think we have? Repeatedly? Read the post. I did show it to be true. Not in excruciating detail, but just by appealing to all of the towering intellects throughout history and up until the present that have accepted some religion as true.   And I am sure some atheists have engaged with the arguments Im talking about, but many of them have not. Just look at Stephen Fry and his Big Think interview. He thinks saying why is there so much evil in the world is a knockdown objection to the existence of God, when its only the beginning of a discussion that has been going on for thousands of years and can be traced back to Deuteronomy.",

Let's look at the levels:   * Level 6: God, Jesus * Level 5: Pope * Level 4: Archbishop * Level 3: Bishops * Level 2: Priests * Level 1: Deacons * Level 0: Members  Remember the development of this system was based on the era it was develop. It was a time of Kings and Queens, and other Royals. It is not a egalitarian society on which this structure was formed. Plus, the fact that men were in charge, the positions created that had power left out women.  The book it self describes it's own hierarchy of what a church should be. Ok sure, but I dont exactly understand how this would mean the exclusion of women from the hierarchy is not a misogynistic decision.",

When you see your sect as just one among many, and no reason why *it's* true versus others, Pascal's Wager collapses because it doesn't include a provision for selecting the right sect.
